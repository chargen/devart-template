# Shapes

I have added more shapes to the code.
Currently, I have implemented shapes for:
- regular octagon
- star like shape
- square
- arrow
- u shape
- bevelled corner shape

The following image shows all six shapes mapped onto the bounded plane.
Each shape has a different hue. 
The saturation and value will fall off away from the centre.
The packing constant c=1.3 was used.
A total of 1897 instances were placed, (the moment when my patience ran out, and I aborted the placement.)
