# Colours

When procedurally assigning colours, I find that it is best to work in HSV colour space, not RGB colour space.

This is because you have better control on the saturation of the colours, and also the darkness of the colours.
A lot of my sample images vary saturation in the horizontal direction, and darkness in the vertical direction.
This can give the image a more interesting look. Also, I typically vary hue by shape type.

It is very easy to mix up this mapping of H S and V of course.
Possibilities for exploration are endless.
