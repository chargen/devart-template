# Project Title
Random Space Filling

## Authors
- Bram Stolk, (stolk)

## Description
Randomly filling a bounded plane with an infinite number of non overlapping objects is an interesting premise.
To avoid running out of space one has to shrink each additional object.
But how much to shrink them? Shrink too fast, and the space will look empty.
Shrink them too slow, and you cannot find an empty spot for the next shape.
It turns out that the area should follow a pow( i, -c ) sequence.
